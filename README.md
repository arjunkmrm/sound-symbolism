# Sound Symbolism

This folder contains the experimental set up for my study investigating unimodal sound symbolism. The experiment was designed using the jsPsych library. Open index.html in a browser to run the experiment. Open it in an IDE to check/modify the code.

For more information about jsPsych, visit: https://www.jspsych.org/7.1/
For a demo experiment along with explanation, visit: https://www.jspsych.org/7.0/tutorials/rt-task/

All stimulus used in the experiment is accessed from within the jsPsych folder, however, there is an additional copy of all stimulus used in the main folder under
'Stimulus'.
