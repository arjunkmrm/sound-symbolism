# Sound Symbolism

This folder contains the experimental set up and docs for the study investigating unimodal sound symbolism. The experiment was designed using the jsPsych library. Open index.html in a browser to run the experiment, or you can also check my deployment at: https://arjunkmrm.github.io/sound-symbolism/

Open it in an IDE to check/modify the code.

For more information about jsPsych, visit: https://www.jspsych.org/7.1/
For a demo experiment along with explanation, visit: https://www.jspsych.org/7.0/tutorials/rt-task/

All stimulus used in the experiment is accessed in the code from within the jsPsych folder. The stimulus files can also be found within the docs folder, organized based on the type of stimulus.
